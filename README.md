Pros:

Code Quality: TDD often results in cleaner, more maintainable code. By focusing on one small piece of functionality at a time, you're encouraged to write concise and focused code blocks. The end result is fewer bugs and a codebase that's easier to understand.

Simplified Debugging: When you have a comprehensive set of tests, debugging becomes less cumbersome. If a bug does emerge, it is usually caught early, and the problem space is smaller. You're likely to spend less time chasing down issues, saving both time and resources.

Design Improvement: TDD helps in making better design decisions. As you have to consider how to structure your code to make it testable, you often end up with a more modular and flexible architecture. This makes it easier to implement changes later on without affecting other parts of the system.

Code Confidence: The comprehensive suite of tests created during a TDD process acts as a safety net, helping developers feel more confident when making changes to the code. This is especially beneficial in larger projects where changes in one part of the codebase could have unforeseen impacts elsewhere.

Documentation: The test cases themselves act as a form of documentation that stays up-to-date. Developers can look at the tests to understand what a particular function is supposed to accomplish and how to use it, thus easing the learning curve for new team members.

Cons:

Initial Time Investment: One of the biggest drawbacks is the upfront time required to write tests. This can be particularly taxing for short-term projects or proof-of-concept developments where quick turnaround is a priority.

Learning Curve: TDD is not just a tool but a practice, and it requires time to learn and master. This is especially a challenge if the entire team is not trained in TDD, as the practice demands discipline and can lead to inefficiencies if not implemented correctly.

Incomplete Test Coverage: While TDD encourages writing tests, it does not inherently guarantee that all edge cases or paths will be tested. Poorly written or incomplete tests can result in a false sense of security, leaving room for bugs to go unnoticed.

Overemphasis on Unit Testing: TDD tends to emphasize unit tests at the expense of other types of testing like integration, system, or user acceptance tests. While unit tests are important, they can't catch every kind of bug, particularly those that arise from the interaction between different units or systems.

Test Maintenance: As your code evolves, so must your tests. This can result in a maintenance burden as failing tests have to be updated to reflect changes in the codebase. If tests are not updated, you end up with a test suite that can no longer serve as an effective safety net.
